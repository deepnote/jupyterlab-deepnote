Deepnote is a data notebook for AI era. `jupyterlab-deepnote` is a JupyterLab extension that enables you to open and view [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com) project files (`.deepnote` format) directly within JupyterLab. This extension provides a seamless read-only viewer for Deepnote notebooks, allowing you to explore Deepnote projects without leaving your JupyterLab environment.

### Key features

- üìÇ **Open Deepnote files**: View `.deepnote` project files containing Deepnote notebooks in JupyterLab
- üìì **Multi-notebook support**: Switch between multiple notebooks within a single `.deepnote` file
- üëÅÔ∏è **Read-only mode**: View notebook content safely without modifying the original `.deepnote` file
- üîÑ **Seamless integration**: Works natively with JupyterLab's notebook interface
- üé® **Deepnote block support**: Renders Deepnote-specific block types as Jupyter cells

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **JupyterLab**: 4.0.0 or higher

### Install via pip

Install the extension using pip, see our [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-deepnote/):

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-deepnote
```

The extension will be automatically enabled after installation.

### Verify installation

Check that the extension is properly installed and enabled:

```bash
# Check server extension
jupyter server extension list

# Check frontend extension
jupyter labextension list
```

You should see `jupyterlab_deepnote` listed in both outputs.

## Usage

### Opening Deepnote files

1. **Launch JupyterLab**:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Open a `.deepnote` file**:
   - Use the file browser to navigate to your `.deepnote` file
   - Double-click the file to open it in the notebook viewer

3. **Switch between notebooks** (if the `.deepnote` file contains multiple notebooks):
   - Use the notebook picker dropdown in the toolbar
   - Select the notebook you want to view

## Architecture

This extension consists of two main components:

- **Server extension**: Handles `.deepnote` file parsing and conversion to Jupyter notebook format. Not all the blocks are supported; visit [docs](https://deepnote.com/docs?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=github&utm_content=readme_main) to learn more
- **Frontend extension**: Provides the JupyterLab UI integration and notebook picker widget

The extension uses a custom content provider to intercept `.deepnote` file requests and transform them into Jupyter-compatible notebook content.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not loading

If the extension doesn't appear to be working:

1. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   jupyter server extension list
   jupyter labextension list
   ```

2. **Rebuild JupyterLab** (if installed from source):

   ```bash
   jupyter lab build
   ```

3. **Check for errors**:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab --debug
   ```

### Common issues

- **`.deepnote` files not opening**: Ensure the file extension is exactly `.deepnote`
- **Missing notebooks**: Verify the `.deepnote` file contains valid YAML-formatted Deepnote project data
- **Extension conflicts**: Try disabling other notebook-related extensions temporarily

### Getting help
